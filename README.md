This is a development of a custom Firmware for the WVC700R3 solar micro inverter because the original Firmware has many bugs and a non working MPPT.

ATTENTION: The device works with high voltage and is directly connected to the grid. Use this stuff only when you know what you do. I am not responsible for any damage or injury!
